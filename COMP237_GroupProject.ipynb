      "Input: Hey Music Fans I really appreciate any of you who will take the time to read this, and check my music out! I&#39;m just a 15 year old boy DREAMING of being a successful MUSICIAN in the music world. I do lots of covers, and piano covers. But I don&#39;t have money to advertise. A simple thumbs up to my comment, a comment on my videos or a SUBSCRIPTION would be a step forward! It will only be a few seconds of your life that you won&#39;t regret!!! Thank u to all the people who just give me a chance! :)  \n",
